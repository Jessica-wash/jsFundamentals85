//These are example notes
// Addition Operator
r += 1; //r = r + 1;

// Subtraction Operator
r -= 1; //r = r - 1;

//Multiplication Operator
r *= 1; //r = r * 1;

//Division Operator
r /= 1; //r = r / 1

//Remainder(Modulous) -used to find/see if their is a remainder
r %= 1; //r = r % 1;

//Exponential Operator
r **= 1; //r = r ** 2; (r^2, r squared)
